Step by step process to construct Neural Network with and without bias nodes.
Examples to illustrate the working of Neural Networks.
Some examples need MNIST dataset, download it from these links (mnist_train.csv)[https://www.python-course.eu/data/mnist/mnist_train.csv] and (mnist_test.csv)[https://www.python-course.eu/data/mnist/mnist_test.csv].
