Given 4 points of the form (xi, yi) in 2D plane, find out if the lines formed by (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3), (x4, y4) are perpendicular to each other. \

### Input format

First line T is the number of test cases. Each test case is followed by 2 lines. \
The first line of every test case contains four integers (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). \
The second line contains four integers (x3, y3) and (x4, y4).

### Output format

For every test case : \
print "YES" without quotes if the lines are perpendicular to each other \
print "NO" without quotes if the lines are not perpendicular \
print "INVALID" without quotes if there are less than 2 lines.
